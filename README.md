# Pineapples UI
NativeBase Design System

## Description
Design system based on NativeBase, which is a cross-platform UI library for React-Native and web.  NativeBase is built on styled-system library, so customization is fast.  Theming is very simple, as it follows the styled-system patter, which will allow us to easily add branded themes on the fly.

This design system is in development and will be part of our Pineapples Nx monorepo boilerplate.
